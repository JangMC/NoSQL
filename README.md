Projects leveraging NoSQL

A Chicago Tribune watchdog report noted that the city of Chicago had only 33 working field inspectors to cover the entire city. Many facilties serve food for children, and while few fail inspections, many escape routine inspections. The goal of this project is to identify the hot-spots (areas that have facilities serving food to children and have failed inspections in the past) on the Chicago map to dispatch inspectors.


Included in this anaysis is:
- NoSQL database Engine (ElasticSearch) for indexing and data retrieval of Chicago Food Inspections
- HeatMap to plot the children facilties that failed Chicago Food Inspections
